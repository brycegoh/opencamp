# Review of Technical design document
We will be reviewing the following technical design document:
[Choosing the best protocol for location check-ins](https://github.com/AllenLi0110/open-camp-backend-course/blob/main/w1-assignment/protocol-research/choosing-the-best-protocol-for-location-check-ins.md)

## Difference in Analysis
- Felt that the conclusion lacks depth and could be more detailed by stringing together all the points made previously.
- No discussion on how ActivityPub is already being used in the wild and that we could use that to our advantage in terms of user adoption. This is especially important for business and product people.
- SWOT analysis could be further expanded with reasnong since audience includes technical people.

## Pros and Cons missed out
- Missed out ActivityPub's data schema is extensible.
- Missed out that ActivityPub is a W3C standard and that scalability has been proven by Mastodon.
- No mention on content moderation for either protocol.
